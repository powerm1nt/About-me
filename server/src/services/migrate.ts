/**
 * Applies pending Prisma migrations at startup.
 *
 * The database is private to the VPC, so a workstation cannot reach it and migrations have to run
 * from inside — either here, as the API boots, or through the hisuiki-migrate Cloud Run job for a
 * migration that should land without a deploy.
 *
 * Concurrency is safe: `prisma migrate deploy` takes an advisory lock on the database, so several
 * instances starting at once serialise rather than racing. A failure is deliberately fatal — a
 * revision serving requests against a schema it was not built for is worse than one that will not
 * start, and Cloud Run keeps the previous revision live when the new one never becomes ready.
