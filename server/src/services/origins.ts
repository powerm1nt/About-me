/**
 * Which origins the API answers to.
 *
 * Production runs on a fixed allow-list: an origin that is not named is refused, which is what
 * keeps the session cookie from being sent to somewhere it should not go.
 *
 * Development has a second, narrower rule. The compose stack binds 0.0.0.0 so the app can be opened
 * from a phone or another machine, and that arrives as http://10.x.x.x:5173 — an origin no static
 * list can predict. When TRUST_PRIVATE_NETWORK_ORIGINS is set, origins on a private network are
 * accepted as well. It is never set in production, where trusting a private address would mean
 * trusting anything sharing the VPC.
