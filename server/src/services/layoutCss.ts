/**
 * Confines every widget stylesheet in a layout to the widget it belongs to.
 *
 * The layout is the one part of a profile the client sends as an opaque document: the server does
 * not otherwise care what is in it, and stores it as JSON. That is fine for sizes and orderings, and
 * not fine at all for the Inspector's Advanced tab, which lets somebody write CSS. Without this,
 * that CSS would be saved unexamined and then served to everyone who opens the profile — able to
 * restyle the app's own chrome, cover the page with a fixed-position overlay, or call out to a
 * third-party URL from a visitor's browser.
 *
 * So each widget's `style.css` is run through the same filter the profile's custom stylesheet uses,
 * scoped to that widget's own id, and the result is stored beside it as `style.scopedCss`. The
 * client renders only the scoped form. The author's source is kept unchanged so the editor can show
 * back what they actually wrote rather than a rewritten version of it.
 *
 * A `scopedCss` that arrives from the client is discarded and recomputed, always. It is the field
 * that is trusted at render time, so it is the one field the client must never be able to set.
