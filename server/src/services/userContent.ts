/**
 * Rendering and sanitising everything a user writes: post bodies, profile pages, and the custom CSS
 * a profile carries.
 *
 * Two separate problems live here, and both are security boundaries rather than formatting niceties:
 *
 *   HTML — posts are markdown but may contain a small amount of hand-written HTML, which means the
 *   rendered output is untrusted by definition. It goes through an allow-list, not a block-list:
 *   anything not named below is removed, so a tag or attribute invented after this was written is
 *   dropped rather than passed through.
 *
 *   CSS — a stylesheet is not inert. Selectors can be used to exfiltrate page content one attribute
 *   at a time by triggering background requests, a fixed-position element can cover the real UI to
 *   harvest clicks, and @import pulls in a stylesheet this code never sees. So user CSS is parsed,
 *   filtered, and rewritten with every selector confined to the author's own container.
