 * A widget's own appearance, and how it becomes CSS.
 *
 * Everything here except the custom stylesheet is a number or one of a fixed set of words. That is
 * deliberate: these values come out of a stored document that a determined person can write by hand,
 * so they are read back through a clamp rather than trusted, and they reach the page as custom
 * properties on the element rather than as a string that gets interpolated into CSS. A number that
 * has been forced into a range cannot escape the property it is assigned to.
 *
 * The custom stylesheet is the exception, and it is why `css` and `scopedCss` are two fields. What
 * the author wrote is kept so the editor can show it back to them; what the page renders is only
 * ever the version the server has confined to this widget's own selector. The client never injects
 * the raw source, on this page or anybody else's.

 * The faces a widget can be set in.
 *
 * A named set rather than a free-text family, for the same reason every other style field is a fixed
 * word: the value ends up in a font-family declaration, and one that came from a stored document
 * could otherwise carry whatever it liked into the stylesheet.
 *
 * All of them are stacks of faces the machine already has. Nothing here fetches: a widget that pulls
 * a font from a third party tells that third party who is reading the page, which is not a thing a
 * profile should do to its visitors without asking.
