 * Nothing about it is specific to being a header, which is the point — the same widget makes a
 * footer, a sidebar, or a two-column strip in the middle of a profile, depending only on where it
 * sits and which flow it is set to.
 *
 * The children arrive already rendered as a board, so dragging, nesting and the gallery stay the
 * board's business rather than being reimplemented here.
