 * Nothing, taking up room.
 *
 * A gap is a real design decision — pushing the account tile to the far end of a bar, holding a
 * column open, separating two groups that would otherwise read as one — and doing it with an empty
 * text widget leaves something on the page that says it is text.
 *
 * It is the one widget that cannot show itself: invisible is the whole point, and an invisible
 * gallery tile is an empty box. So in a tile, and while the page is being arranged, it draws its
 * own mark; on the finished page it draws nothing at all.
