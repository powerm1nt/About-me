# Two Cloud Run services from one image, split by origin:
#
#   hisuiki.com      -> hisuiki-web   APP_ROLE=web   serves the built React frontend, no /api
#   api.hisuiki.com  -> hisuiki-api   APP_ROLE=api   serves Express /api, no static files
#
# One image rather than two because the frontend build and the API build already share a repository,
# a lockfile, and a release; splitting the artifact would mean two pipelines to keep in step for no
# gain. APP_ROLE decides what a revision mounts (see server/src/index.ts).
#
# The split itself is what costs something: the browser now talks to a different origin than it was
# served from, so the session cookie has to be scoped to the parent domain and CORS has to name the
# frontend explicitly. Both are configured below and neither is optional.
